# Experiment 1: Assessing Temperature and Fasting Period on Dietary DNA Detection

These data correspond to analyses performed to examine the effects of temperature and fasting period on the detectability of host DNA in sea lamprey dietary samples.

### Methods

Sea lamprey were fed lake trout in a controlled setting at three temperatures (5, 10, and 15Â°C). 
After seven days of feeding, lamprey were then separated into five fasting period groups (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days) prior to collection of dietary samples.
Dietary DNA was collected via a swab, extracted, amplified, barcoded and sequenced.
